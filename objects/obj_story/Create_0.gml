txt =  "The golden banana. An ancient artifact of immeasurable value, coveted by the most prestigious collectors in all of Monkey Society. Three months ago you came into possession of a map claiming to lead to this wondrous item. It claims the treasure is hidden in the centre of a mysterious island and that it can only be acquired once the sacred torch of Monkey has been lit. However, the map suggests the path through the island will be unfit for any land, water or air vehicles. But you won't let this stop you, you and your team of Monkey Engineers have secretly developed the CHIMP-D (Compressed Heat Induction Master Propulsion Device), it will allow you to navigate the island and be the key to securing your prize. I wish you luck, Brave Explorer."
